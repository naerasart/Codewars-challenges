//Sentence Smash
/* Write a function that takes an array of words and 

smashes them together into a sentence and returns the 

sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words 

or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between 

each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at 

the beginning or the end of the sentence! */
